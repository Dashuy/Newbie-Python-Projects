# PDF_Merger

Creating a PDF file merger in Python can be accomplished using the PyPDF2 library. This library allows you to manipulate PDF files, including merging multiple PDFs into one. If you haven't already installed the library, you can do so using the following command:

$ pip install PyPDF2

In main.py code, replace 'file1.pdf', 'file2.pdf', etc. with the paths to the PDF files you want to merge. The resulting merged PDF will be saved as 'merged.pdf'.

PyPDF2 library has some limitations, such as not being able to handle certain advanced PDF features. If you encounter any issues with complex PDFs, you might need to explore other libraries like pdfrw or PyMuPDF.
